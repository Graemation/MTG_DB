# MTG_DB
The code snippets used to create my Excel based MTG Card Database

The file here is to be used when creating you own Excel DB of Magic cards/ i didn't want to load mine up, as I show you how to import the data from the SkyFall Json file, and as I got it from there, and it isn't my data - I thought I would just avoid any legal issues, and not load it it here.

Just watch the video <Pending video - needed code here first before video is created>
